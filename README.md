These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the GitHub product team. Check out [Making suggestions](#making-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback.

When creating a new post, make sure to choose the predetermined category that best fits your topic. This will ensure that conversations are indexed by their corresponding product or feature, to help community members quickly find answers to their questions.

## Making suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/xiaozhu2007/-/discussion) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our products. You don't need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion. We hope to foster productive and collaborative conversations, so please check out [how to give good feedback](https://github.com/xiaozhu2007/-/discussions/1) for guidance on how to kick off a successful discussion.

Prior to creating a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already shared your suggestion(s). If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new one.

### From a suggestion to a shipped feature

Once you start the discussion, the product team will evaluate the feedback, but will not be able to respond to each submission. From then on, we will work with you and the entire community to ensure that we understand what the product does not currently have and explore the potential solution space for your problem statement:

- If the product team determines that we will give priority to a function to solve the problem you identified, we will open a problem in Issues and track its development

- If the product team determines that we will not try to solve the problem you find, we can comment on the discussion describing our reasoning so that our decisions remain transparent.

## Disclaimer

Any statements in this repository that are not purely historical are considered forward-looking statements. Forward looking comments in the public feedback discussion do not represent a commitment, warranty, obligation or commitment to deliver any product or feature on any particular date, or to deliver any product or feature, which is intended to outline the overall development plan. You should not rely on these public feedback discussions to make any purchase decisions.
